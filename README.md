# Algorithm Challenge #18 – Encrypt/Decrypt Text
-

🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a text string from the user and applies a simple encryption
method by shifting each character forward using an integer key (Caesar Cipher).

To decrypt the text, the algorithm shifts each encrypted character backward
by the same key, restoring the original message.

The approach:

1️⃣ Read the original text  
2️⃣ Encrypt it by shifting characters using:   encrypted = char + key  
3️⃣ Decrypt it using the reverse operation:    original  = char - key  

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
ASCII-based text manipulation  
Simple Caesar-shift encryption  
Reversing encryption using subtraction  
Character-by-character iteration  
Clean and modular C++ function design  

🧩 Example
-
Input:  
Hello

Output:  
Text Before Encryption : Hello  
Text After Encryption  : Jgnnq  
Text After Decryption  : Hello  

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++  
File Name: encrypt_decrypt_text.cpp  
Challenge Number: #18  

💬 Notes
-
This challenge demonstrates the core idea of symmetric encryption.
While simple, it forms the basis of many classical cryptographic algorithms.
